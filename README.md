## Making the game agrovation in python
A game that has been played in my family for as long as I can remember.
Basic rules for the game are moving all of your marbles/units from the home(start) to the base(finish) with some restrictions on how you can move

### Rules
On each turn roll a single dice and can move any marble of your choice that number of spaces, if you roll a 6 you get to roll again.  In order to leave your "Home" you need to roll a 6 or a 1.  When moving if you roll a 4 you move backwords instead of forwards.  If a piece you control would land on a piece an opponent controls that piece is knocked back home and the player has to roll a 1 or 6 again to get it out again. 

If you have no legal moves you have to skip your turn.

### Goal
In order to win you have to move your piece around the board and into your base when you move into the base a piece is safe and can not be knocked back home by other players any more, the first player to have all four of their pieces in the base is the winner.
